# Classifying Movie Genres
Fatima Jangda, Noelle Lim, Eeman Salman

This repository contains the work for our ECE324 project on classifying movie genres based on movie synopses.

### Data 
The data folder contains csvs to the data we have used (3 csvs from Kaggle datasets and 1 csv from human classified movie genres). 
Also in the data folder is the code that was used to extract the respective csvs from Kaggle, concatenate all inputs (movie synopsis) and outputs (multi-class label of genre), and randomly split the dataset of 52,448 data points into train, validation, and testing with a 80:10:10 split to test our models.

Please refer to the Jupyter notebook in the data folder titled 'DataGathering.ipynb' to see how our data was extracted, cleaned up, concatenated, and split into respective training, validation, and test sets.
