# Classifying Movie Genres
ECE324 Project

This repository contains the work for our ESC324 project on classifying movie genres based on movie synopses.

The data folder contains csvs to the data we have used (3 csvs from Kaggle datasets and 1 csv from human classified movie genres). 
Also in the data folder is the code that was used to extract the respective csvs from Kaggle, concatenate all inputs (movie synopses) and outputs (multi class label of genre), and split the dataset of 52,448 data points into train, validation, and testing with a 80:10:10 split.
